<h1 class="text-5xl font-bold mb-8">Working on a 1999 Ford Ranger <span class="mr-2 text-red-500">Its Red</span></h1>
<p class="text-xl">The other day, I had the joy of solo replacing the starter on the ever so cleverly named, <span class="mr-2 text-red-500">danger</span>ranger</p>
<span class="mr-2 text-red-500">•••••••••••</span>
<p class="text-xl text-red-500">DANGER</p>
<span class="mr-2 text-red-500">•••••••••••</span>
<p class="text-xl">Aptly called that because if you’re laid out underneath one, torquing off the bolts with damn near zero leverage and only 2 (you hope) trusty jack stands holding up 5,000 lbs of redneck engineering, there’s this quiet little voice that pipes up while you’re reefing on a 26-year-old 13mm:</p>
<p class="text-xl italic"><span class="mr-2 text-green-500">"If this thing shifts just enough, brother, you’re gonna be the meat in a Ford sandwich."</span></p>
<br>
<p class="text-xl">And right then, the truck does that thing. You know the thing. A tiny little creak from the frame, a microscopic wobble in the stand, and suddenly every single one of your pivotal life decisions and moments start playing on the IMAX screen inside your skull at 240 fps.</p>
<br>
<p class="text-xl">I had seen myself at 14 years old, learning to drive a Ranger for the first time. Age 19, graduating college, to become a mechanic, to excel at what I was in the act of doing, many years later...</p>
<br>
<p class="text-xl">All of it, 4K, Dolby Atmos, the full lifetime timeline, in the two seconds between “pop” and the jack stand settling back into place.</p>
<br>
<p class="text-xl">Then the bolt breaks loose, the truck settles, and you exhale a breath you didn’t know you were holding.</p>
<br>
<p class="text-xl">You lie there for a second, covered in rust and ATF, heart doing its best impression of a meth’d-up hummingbird, and you laugh. Because you’re still alive, the starter’s finally loose, and somewhere in the cosmos the universe just shrugged and said, “Eh, not today, buddy.”</p>
<br>
<p class="text-xl">That, my friends, is the Danger Ranger experience. All in the name of keeping a good thing going.</p>
